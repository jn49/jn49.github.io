<p>When it comes to eating disorders--especially anorexia--the textbook explanation for their cause is because of control. Even Marya Hornbacher in her book <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByRH9kO5qnjfa3dPYlFVYW1qZVluaW5tU3d4SFIyXzJBQWdv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><i>Wasted</i></a> says, <blockquote>"If you are bulimic,  it is assumed that you come from a chaotic family. If you are an anoretic, it is assumed you come from a rigid and controlling family. As it happens, mine was both."</blockquote> I think to an extent, I can see myself in Marya and understand what she means. Though our lives are completely different, there are commonalities that may have contribute to eating disorders as our poison of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's no question that my family is strict and overbearing. It's just part of the Asian culture. Not that I mind it or anything. I grew up with it and I understand why things are the way they are so I hold no resentment or blame towards my parents. But to be honest, it feels degrading to be told that my issues more than likely originated from the lack of control in my life. It's almost like being told that the reason I'm slowly killing myself is because I wasn't allowed to do anything in life. I mean I understand why "control" is such a big thing when it comes to eating disorders, but I don't think it's the whole picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've grown accustomed to not really having any control in my life so maybe my opinions are biased and/or flawed but I will try my best to contemplate how control has impacted my life and personality. </p>
<p></p>
<p>From childhood, I could already tell how my parents'--mostly my mom's--control prevented my siblings and I from living our life to the fullest. As children, we lived in an apartment complex where there were many other kids. But we were never allowed to go outside to play with them. My mom said it was unsafe to go outside and kept on harping about how we could get kidnapped by some horrible stranger. My mom was a broken record when it came to saying how unsafe the world is. But I understood that her controlling nature towards us was because she was our mother and didn't want anything bad to happen to us. She carried us for nine months in her tummy and took care of us all our lives,--of course she wouldn't want anything bad to happen to us. But on the other hand, I feel that she's a hypocrite when it comes to her saying the world is unsafe. She grew up in Vietnam in the 1970s, and could go anywhere she pleased. Her mother did not keep as close tabs on my mother as my mom did for us because my grandma was always working. My mom told us these fun stories of all the trouble she got into growing up, but I couldn't help but listen to them with a twinge of bitterness. She said Vietnam was a lot safer than America and that no one had to be afraid walking on the street. Because of this, even when I'm already an adult I am not allowed to walk up and down my street by myself.
