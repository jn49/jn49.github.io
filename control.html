<p>When it comes to eating disorders--especially anorexia--the textbook explanation for their cause is because of control. Even Marya Hornbacher in her book <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByRH9kO5qnjfa3dPYlFVYW1qZVluaW5tU3d4SFIyXzJBQWdv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><i>Wasted</i></a> says, <blockquote>"If you are bulimic,  it is assumed that you come from a chaotic family. If you are an anoretic, it is assumed you come from a rigid and controlling family. As it happens, mine was both."</blockquote> I think to an extent, I can see myself in Marya and understand what she means. Though our lives are completely different, there are commonalities that may have contribute to eating disorders as our poison of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's no question that my family is strict and overbearing. It's just part of the Asian culture. Not that I mind it or anything. I grew up with it and I understand why things are the way they are so I hold no resentment or blame towards my parents. But to be honest, it feels degrading to be told that my issues more than likely originated from the lack of control in my life. It's almost like being told that the reason I'm slowly killing myself is because I wasn't allowed to do anything in life. I mean I understand why "control" is such a big thing when it comes to eating disorders, but I don't think it's the whole picture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've grown accustomed to not really having any control in my life so maybe my opinions are biased and/or flawed but I will try my best to contemplate how control has impacted my life and personality. Personally, the best way to view myself is to dissociate myself from me--like to think as if I am a character in a book and conduct literary analyses on my character? Or at least I prefer to think of myself in this way. This was something I always enjoyed doing in English class, and literary analysis comes natural to me so this seems like the most reasonable way for me to "discover" myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From childhood, I could already tell how my parents'--mostly my mom's--control prevented my siblings and I from living our life to the fullest. As children, we lived in an apartment complex where there were many other kids. But we were never allowed to go outside to play with them. My mom said it was unsafe to go outside and kept on harping about how we could get kidnapped by some horrible stranger. My mom was a broken record when it came to saying how unsafe the world is. But I understood that her controlling nature towards us was because she was our mother and didn't want anything bad to happen to us. She carried us for nine months in her tummy and took care of us all our lives,--of course she wouldn't want anything bad to happen to us. But on the other hand, I feel that she's a hypocrite when it comes to her saying the world is unsafe. She grew up in Vietnam in the 1970s, and could go anywhere she pleased. Her mother did not keep as close tabs on my mother as my mom did for us because my grandma was always working. My mom told us these fun stories of all the trouble she got into growing up, but I couldn't help but listen to them with a twinge of bitterness. She said Vietnam was a lot safer than America and that no one had to be afraid walking on the street. Because of this, even when I'm already an adult I am not allowed to walk up and down my street by myself.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think it wouldn't be wrong to say that my parents' strict and controlling nature led to me becoming an isolated person. After all, childhood is a key time in builing social skills and learning how to interact with others in society. Since I wasn't allowed to go on playdates or have friends over my house since my parents thought that may lead to some unforeseen conflict, I wasn't able to make many long-lasting friendships. To some, this may seem sad and lonely, but I've gotten used to it. This is normal to me. But there are times where I see groups of people enjoying themselves and being happy and sometimes this makes me feel a bit lonely. However, when I think of the effort needed in order to keep friendships alive, everything just seems to exhausting and draining so I don't bother. Even now when people try to make friends with me and keep in contact with me, I just don't find it enjoyable at all. When I'm with others I can't be the <i>real</i> me so why should I even bother making friends? After all, if they knew what I was dealing with I doubt anyone would want to be friends with me anymore. I'd be too much to handle. Too ridiculous to spend time with. This is why I only have 1.5 friends.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could also attribute my indecisiveness to not having much control in my life? I mean when you live your whole life not having a say in anything and then one day you're finally able to decide on something, how are you supposed to choose? I haven't really had the liberty to make my own decisions, so I'm not really used to it yet. But on the other hand, I'd say that my indecisiveness is due to me wanting too much? When living a life of being denied things and then finally being able to choose things, how could you choose just one? Why not choose everything? As of now, I don't have much of a problem with my indecisiveness, but I can see where it gets irritating for others around me. For example, whenever my boyfriend takes me out to eat or when I go shopping and have to decide on what I need and/or want to buy. I also feel that my indecisiveness is the reason why I hate surveys and questionaires. I find it too hard to be honest on them. It's like I answer them in a way that I'm "expected" to? I especially hated those aptitude tests to choose what carrer you'd be best suited for in the future because I always chose the answers that best suited the career I had in mind.
 </p>
<p></p>
<p>What's bizarre to my peers when I tell them I can't do something because I'd have to ask for permission first or because my parent's wouldn't approve is that I'm a legal adult but I still listen to my parents as if I was a kid (I will touch more upon this at a later time). To an extent, I agree but after all I still live in my parents' house so I must listen their wishes and do what they want. My parents still own me. Plus I would find it so disrepectful to my parents if I rebelled and gave them a hard time. They spent so many years taking care of me how could I just disregard everything they've ever done for me and do whatever I want? Without them there could have been no me so in a way, I'm an extension of them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Probably the most revelant product of my parents' control over me is my ability to overplan my life in order to avoid undesirable consequences. The biggest example would be when I spend time with Trey (my boyfriend). Usually, I am only able to see him when he asks my mom permission to take me out on a date or when my mom asks him to take me to school. So technically, this means that I see him perhaps once or twice every few months during school time and maybe once a week during vacation time. I've been dating Trey for almost five years and this is how my mother sees I should spend time with Trey. But to me, this schedule is absolutely ridiculous!! In reality, I see Trey on an average of two times a week. My parents know that I'm a studious person and spend many hours studying, but two times a week, I take advantage of their trust in me and sneak out of school in order to spend time with him. But whenever I see him I also have to remember to leave time to "air out" since he has family members who smoke inside the house. I also make sure that I carry perfume with me to mask the scent and to leave his house at a time when I know none of my family members will be driving. It cuts into my time with him, but it's better to be safe than sorry. If I came home smelling like smoke, my parents would assume that I was somwhere where people smoked which would eventually lead them to suspect that I was spending time with Trey. Also if by some chance my family sees me in the car with Trey, I would be ratted out for sure. I can't take the risk of there being loopholes in the things I plan so I try to think of every possible scenario.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the ugly side of things, I'd say that the lack of control in my life has led to me being an angry person. I don't like to think of myself as one, but when I think of it I really am an angry person. Not being able to have freedom in my life could have led me to have this pent up anger and resentment in the world--not my parents--that I couldn't do anything about it. But being the "perfect" daughter to my parents who is well-behanved and feminine how could I explode with anger? Anger is not a beautiful thing. Not to mention that if I showcase my anger to my parents, they would think that I'm being an insolent child. I'm my parents' first-born highest achieving daughter. How could I disappoint them? There were a few different ways I dealt with that anger. At first I threw myself into my studies with the hope that if I showed them how well I do then perhaps they would grant me with more liberties. Nope! Nothing changed. My anger began to leak out into my interests, I came to love heavy metal and screamo and all the loud music I could listen to. The songs were able to scream when I couldn't. Even to this day I still love heavy metal and no one ever believes me when I say it's my favorite genre of music. They all say I'm too shy and cute to like something so loud and violent.
</p>
<p>Another way I found that helped ease my anger was running. As it turned out, running killed two birds with one stone. I could burn off calories to lose weight and I could tire myself out to the point I didn't have the energy to be angry anymore. I started getting serious about running towards the end of middle school. I joined the track team and the cross-country team and I loved taking the time to run in order to relax. But then my mom became angry that she had to pick me up after practices, which eventually led to me being kicked off the team since I kept asking to go home early on the afterschool bus so I wouldn't anger my mom. Now I'm able to run more often since one of my brothers goes to the gym almost everyday and I'm able to use the fitness center at school. But back then I was so angry that my mother got in the way of me trying to do something that I whole-heartedly enjoyed. When I can't run, I get so angry and moody and frustrated I hate it. I feel addicted to running and being active. It gives me a sense of purpose in life and really does help me to relieve stress.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess pent up anger has ultimately led me to a form of self-harm as well? There are times where I just get so angry at myself and my situation that I can't help but to bruise myself--usually my arms. The first few times I burised my arms were complete accidents that happened during the badminton unit during gym class. There's just something beautiful about bruises to me that I don't entirely understand? I had friends who self-harmed by cutting, but cutting was something that I could never do. I'm too vain of a person to scar myself forever because of a momentary feeling. But bruising was attractive to me. Personally, I also feel that it takes more self-hatred and anger to bruise yourself than cut yourself--this is just my opinion and I do not mean to belittle cutting. Cutting is so much more life-threatening than bruising, but it also easier to do since the blade does most of the work? If you have a sharp blade then it'd be easy to cut yourself by applying just a bit of pressure. But bruising requires much more force to do and doesn't always happen on the first strike. In order to bruise yourself you would have to be willing to hit yourself over and over without decreasing the force until the blood vessels from the aching spot decide to burst. Bruising hurts and allows me to vent a bit of my anger, but they're also temporary. My bitter mood will disappear the next day or so and the bruise will disappear in a couple of weeks. There won't be any regret of permanently mutilating myself. However, when I bruise myself I do run the risk of hurting my bones and tendons and nerves. But when you're angry and have no other way to deal with that anger, you don't really think about the negative consequenes. My mom had told me that my grandma used to bruise herself too, which I found interesting. I'm not sure if that has any meaning or not.

<p>I'm a bit embarrassed tp say it, but anger and control has also played a role in my relationships and preferences. Way before <i>Fifty Shades of Grey </i> came out, in middle school I became fascinated with S&M and bondage and to an extent even rape. I don't know why but something about it back then was thrilling to me. I could see myself on both sides on the coin--I could be the one yielding because for all my life that's all I've ever known and I could be the dominant one because I was sick of always being the powerless person. Haha or is it because of my indecisiveness that I think that way? Personally, I have a theory that most sadists are masochists at heart, but I have not found any studies to back up my ideas so I'm left with just an unfullfilled hypothesis. Either way, there was something about power and sex that just made me feel alive. Many anorexics avoid sex since they're self-conscious of their bodies while others don't mind it since it gives them an extra opportunity to burn calories. For me, I enjoy sex because it makes me feel wanted and accomplished that this person (well my boyfriend) finds me attractive enough to want to sleep with me. That he craves my touch to the point only I can satisfy him. It's just so rewarding to know I have some kind of power with the body I hate so much? But then again he's also a guy so maybe he just goes along with whatever, who knows. My boyfriend (Trey) grew up with his own issues and subsequently built up his own attitudes towards intimacy but they work perfectly with mine. He's a male, but he lefts me overpower him--in fact he prefers it that way. In our relationship he's the masochist while I'm the sadist? He enjoys being blinfolded and tied up and to an extent harmed, and I'm the one who does it to him. Though there are times where it's reverse. Honestly we don't go by labels much, we just do whatever we're comfortable with.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now I guess the ulimate manifestation of my anger is my eating disorder? I'm the product of my parents but in a way it's my parents' absolute control over me that angers me, so why not destroy what it is they love so much? Sometimes I part of me thnks that the more sick I am, the more afraid my parents would be of losing me or me not being happy so they would let me have more freedom and space. In some cases, this does work. Whenever my mom sees me moping and unwilling to eat, she does release the reins a bit to give me some more freedom on the condition I eat--but I usually sneak it out and throw it in the trash or end up purging it. A part of me is irrational and thinks that my parents don't really love me since they're so controlling so why not just starve myself and when I'm gone they won't have to deal with me anymore? Maybe I'm not good enough for my parents yet so that's why they haven't bestowed upon me many liberties yet? But then how "good" do I have to be until I can have some freedom? Or is it that freedom only truly comes when I no longer exist? It's complicated to think about it all. I'm not sure if my anger has to do anything with my eating disorder or not, I'm just guessing. But I think that a person would really have to amass a great amount of self-hatred and anger to be killing themselves in such a slow and ineffective way. I don't blame my parents. I just blame my inability to healthfully cooperate with the circumstances I am given.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back then I wish I had more control over my life so I could do more things, but now I mostly just want more control in my life so I can eat whatever I want whenever I want. When I live at home with my family, my parents and even my siblings make sure I eat and try to get me to eat if they suspect that I haven't eaten anything yet. I don't like being forced to eat at all. It makes me feel so conflicted inside and sometimes even brings me to tears. I just want to be able to eat on my own accord. As the textbook example, most anorexics find comfort in controlling what they put in their bodies and I can vouch for this. Developing and eating disorder has given me some solace in life when I'm barred from living life to the fullest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I also feel that the issue of control plays a role in my hobbies and how I react to certain things. For example, one of my favorite hobbies is to point my nails. I love painting my nails all different types of sparkly colors. Painting my nails is relaxing and makes me feel feminine. However, this <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/painting-my-nails-kept-me-sane-through-college-and-science-backs-me-up-on-that" target="_blank"> article </a> suggests that nail painting is an activity that helps with anxiety. I feel that it would help in anxiety since it gives the doer control of how the nail painting process will end up. After all, when I do my nails, I control how long I grow them, I control what color I want them to be, I control what shape my nails are--I control every single aspect of my nails and I love it. Nail painting is definitely relaxing, but it is an expensive hobby since my favoirite polishes are indie brand holographics. Another way I see control pop up is with acne. For most of my teenage life I had pimples--I still get them now too. I know they say that you shouldn't pick pimples, but I just don't have the patience to wait to the pimples to go away. You can't rush a pimple to heal. But if you pick the pimple and make a scab, you can definitely control how fast the scab heals. Or at least I thought so. Because of this, I'd prefer a face full of scabs than a face full of pimples any day.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Control is also prevalent in my life in the form of self-control. For Asian woman and girls, self-control is a highly revered trait that determines who is the best of the best. The typical female is seen as a restrained being that is modest and graceful. The more self-control a girl has personality-wise the "better" she is. I guess this could be one reason why so many girls in Asia have unhealthy eating habits, but it's seen as the norm there. Asian girls are perhaps the slimmest girls I have ever seen. Personally, I feel like a failure when I see that I'm not a slim person. It makes me wish I was slimmer. I guess one thing about eating disorders is that your body is your "trophy". A slim person can boast a tiny body because they had the self-control and dedication to stop themselves from indulging in the unecessary things in life. There's also some sense in pride in being stared at in public and having people see your transformation to become something ethereal. In China, Angelababy has perhaps one of the most "ideal" looks a girl could strive for.
