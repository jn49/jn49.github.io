  <p>I feel kinda shitty today because of yesterday. Yesterday started out like any other day when I'm home alone--I wake up drink coffee and don't eat anything. Yesterday I was also feeling the effects of drinking laxative tea, but it wasn't as satisfying as it normally is? I mean I was able to go and empty my bowels a bit, but I don't feel like I was completely empty? It's hard to explain sometimes when I can't even remember what I was thinking or feeling at the time. It's frustrating that my mind can't seem to recall details and events unless they were somewhat significant to me. But I do remember that yesterday I ate a lot more than I anticipated. Some of it because of my family making me eat, some of it because I just kept on eating. I felt really bad about it. Last night I fell asleep with a full stomach which is one of my pet peeves. I feel that if I sleep after eating that I'll just put on all that food as fat. Last night I didn't sleep very well either. I kept on having nightmares about school and food and waking up in the middle of the night. I didn't get out of bed until 1 PM on Saturday.
  </p>
  <p>I thought that today would have been like a "day of repentance" for yesterday, but my brother came home and made me eat some pizza that he made (He works at Franco's). I also ate a ripe banana and a Clif Bar and I feel like a failure. I tried to purge some of the pizza in the bathroom, but I stopped myself. Bread isn't the nicest of things to purge so I felt like even trying would be in vain.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This evening, I ran an ok amount and then when I got home my mom and dad made me eat dinner with them. The food was good and all, but it just hurts my heart to eat. I even broke my rule of no soda to tried to make it easier for me to purge. After dinner I threw up a bit, but it was not enough to make an impact. I feel like a pig. I keep eating too much and not being able to burn it off. It makes me feel so moody and agitated I don't know what to do. Normally, I only drink laxative tea a couple times a month--but I think this month I would have drank it five to six times already. I know I run the risk of messing up my intestines and my digestive system, but I feel so anxious with all that food inside me I just want it all out as soon as possible. I know that using laxatives won't render the calories meaningless but it's the empty feeling after using laxatives that makes me enjoy using them.</p>
