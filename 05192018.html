  <p>I feel kinda shitty today because of yesterday. Yesterday started out like any other day when I'm home alone--I wake up drink coffee and don't eat anything. Yesterday I was also feeling the effects of drinking laxative tea, but it wasn't as satisfying as it normally is? I mean I was able to go and empty my bowels a bit, but I don't feel like I was completely empty? It's hard to explain sometimes when I can't even remember what I was thinking or feeling at the time. It's frustrating that my mind can't seem to recall details and events unless they were somewhat significant to me. But I do remember that yesterday I ate a lot more than I anticipated. Some of it because of my family making me eat, some of it because I just kept on eating. I felt really bad about it. Last night I fell asleep with a full stomach which is one of my pet peeves. I feel that if I sleep after eating that I'll just put on all that food as fat. Last night I didn't sleep very well either. I kept on having nightmares about school and food and waking up in the middle of the night. I didn't get out of bed until 1 PM on Saturday.
  </p>
  <p>I thought that today would have been like a "day of repentance" for yesterday, but my brother came home and made me eat some pizza that he made (He works at Franco's). I also ate a ripe banana and a Clif Bar and I feel like a failure. I tried to purge some of the pizza in the bathroom, but I stopped myself. Bread isn't the nicest of things to purge so I felt like even trying would be in vain.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>This evening, I ran an ok amount and then when I got home my mom and dad made me eat dinner with them. The food was good and all, but it just hurts my heart to eat. I even broke my rule of no soda to tried to make it easier for me to purge. After dinner I threw up a bit, but it was not enough to make an impact. I feel like a pig. I keep eating too much and not being able to burn it off. It makes me feel so moody and agitated I don't know what to do. Normally, I only drink laxative tea a couple times a month--but I think this month I would have drank it five to six times already. I know I run the risk of messing up my intestines and my digestive system, but I feel so anxious with all that food inside me I just want it all out as soon as possible. I know that using laxatives won't render the calories meaningless but it's the empty feeling after using laxatives that makes me enjoy using them. So I decided to eat some granola bars in order to get some more fiber in my body so that the laxative tea has something to push out. Often, I keep forgetting to drink my tea while it's warm so that may be one reason why it doesn't work as well.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>My parents also wanted to spend some time with me this evening to watch some TV but I just can't keep spending time with them. Personally, I like being alone and just spending time by myself. I love my parents, but if I have to dedicate spending time with them I can't exercise in the privacy in my room or even write in peace. Right now, I'm just relaxing in my room, watching Spongebob, and waiting to drink my lax tea. I may or may not stay up late tonight to exercise. Though I really should, I panic thinking that my arms have gotten bigger. I feel like they jiggle so much more now it makes me so agitated. It might just all be in my head, but I seriously feel like my upper arms have gotten squishier. It makes me feel so bad and self-conscious. I worked really hard to try to make them smaller, I'd be upset if all this eating reversed all my efforts.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I put some thought into it today and I know that I can't keep going on living like this. I mean I can't really picture my life without my eating disorder, but I know there's no way I can live a meaningful life with it. I thought about how nice it'd be not to worry every time I put food in my mouth, but if I stop worrying then a part of me really would be gone. Also, if I stop worrying, then all the years I spent agonizing over food and my body would be for naught. I can't bring myself to stop after investing so much time into it. Sometimes I think that after I reach my goals I'd be able to stop--after all I'm only five pounds away--but I don't know. Of course I want to be healthy and I think that maybe I should just focus my efforts into getting "fit" but I still don't know how I feel about it. Recently I've been lifting weights to help tone up my body, but then that also led to me building some muscle. I don't know how I feel about building muscle. I guess to an extent it's ok to me? Building muscle would require putting on weight though? Honestly, it's not the number that I care so much about, it's how comfortable I feel in my skin at that number? Like if I weighed 120 lbs and felt like the queen of the world then that would be fine with me. But I'm 93 lbs and I feel like a piggy.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I want to say that I'm a rational person and that I know my common sense will kick in when things get bad, but sometimes I have my doubts about that. I feel like my common sense is kicking in now saying that the marginal utility of prolonging my disorded eating is diminishing, but I've grown so accustomed to it I just really can't let it go yet. I don't want to have gotten this close and not have even reached my last goal. I tried explaining to Trey how I want to let all of this go while at the same time not wanting to let it all go and I don't think he completely understands what I mean. It's hard to try to talk to other people about it when no one else can relate. It makes me wish I had a friend who was dealing with the same things as me, but even then I'd question how long that friendship would last.
