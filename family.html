<p>They say that the majority of people suffering from eating disorders have some sort of latent conflict regarding their families. I suppose to an extent this may be true? Personally, I never really gave it much thought that the people I am continuously surrounded by could somehow contribute to my unhealthy eating habits. But now that I think of it, I guess that over the course of my life, my family has played a role in my eating habits and attitude towards food. I am in no way placing the blame on my family for what I've become--I fully accept responsibility for my actions. But in my quest to figure out what is "wrong" with me, I have no choice but to pick at my family and see if there is anything significant in helping me understand myself better. </p>
<br></br>
<h2>AMANDA</h2>
<p>My family consists of seven people: my mom, my dad, my younger sister, my three younger brothers, and then me. Even thoguh my parents are far from perfect, they took care of us to the best of their ability. My siblings and I are all born a year apart, so we pretty much grew up together. My memory isn't as good as it used to be, but I'd say that I got along very well with my brothers--except for the occasional argument of course. But my sister, Amanda, and I were like cat and dog. I remember getting into arguements with her almost every day. It drove my parents crazy. And truth be told, even to this day my sister and I don't really get along as much but usually we are amiable.</p>
<br></br>
<p>I vividly remember certain snippets of my childhood when I fought with my sister. I remember she would threaten to touch my belongings and I would panic so much and cry like a baby. There were times I would hide all my things and/or guard them just to make sure that they were safe from her. I remember that she used to bully me until I was in tears and that she never hesitated to hurt my feelings. Back then, it must have been over stupid, little things that would only bother children. I barely remember what it was she said to me, but I remember crying constantly because of her. There were times where I just cried and cried to cope with my feelings towards my sister, but there were also times I tried to get "even". For example, one day in elementary school, I got so fed up of Amanda and for some reason I decided to pee on her bed because I was so upset. When I look back, I question what it was that I was thinking--but I think it was so that my mom would see the mess and yell at Amanda. That way perhaps she would cry and feel the pain that comes with it? But my sister and I are two different people. She has a strong personality and lets little bother her while I am the complete opposite. Compared to my younger sister, I'm a total pushover.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>Being the only two girls in the house, I guess we were supposed to get along with one another and have a great relationship. But instead of seeing things that way we somehow saw it as <i>because</i> there were only two of us that one of us <i>had</i> to be more loved than the other. Or at least I think it was that way?
