<p>They say that the majority of people suffering from eating disorders have some sort of latent conflict regarding their families. I suppose to an extent this may be true? Personally, I never really gave it much thought that the people I am continuously surrounded by could somehow contribute to my unhealthy eating habits. But now that I think of it, I guess that over the course of my life, my family has played a role in my eating habits and attitude towards food. I am in no way placing the blame on my family for what I've become--I fully accept responsibility for my actions. But in my quest to figure out what is "wrong" with me, I have no choice but to pick at my family and see if there is anything significant in helping me understand myself better. </p>
<br></br>
<h2><b>AMANDA</b></h2>
<p>My family consists of seven people: my mom, my dad, my younger sister, my three younger brothers, and then me. Even thoguh my parents are far from perfect, they took care of us to the best of their ability. My siblings and I are all born a year apart, so we pretty much grew up together. My memory isn't as good as it used to be, but I'd say that I got along very well with my brothers--except for the occasional argument of course. But my sister, Amanda, and I were like cat and dog. I remember getting into arguements with her almost every day. It drove my parents crazy. And truth be told, even to this day my sister and I don't really get along as much but usually we are amiable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I vividly remember certain snippets of my childhood when I fought with my sister. I remember she would threaten to touch my belongings and I would panic so much and cry like a baby. There were times I would hide all my things and/or guard them just to make sure that they were safe from her. I remember that she used to bully me until I was in tears and that she never hesitated to hurt my feelings. Back then, it must have been over stupid, little things that would only bother children. I barely remember what it was she said to me, but I remember crying constantly because of her. There were times where I just cried and cried to cope with my feelings towards my sister, but there were also times I tried to get "even". For example, one day in elementary school, I got so fed up of Amanda and for some reason I decided to pee on her bed because I was so upset. When I look back, I question what it was that I was thinking--but I think it was so that my mom would see the mess and yell at Amanda. That way perhaps she would cry and feel the pain that comes with it? But my sister and I are two different people. She has a strong personality and lets little bother her while I am the complete opposite. Compared to my younger sister, I'm a total pushover.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the only two girls in the house, I guess we were supposed to get along with one another and have a great relationship. But instead of seeing things that way we somehow saw it as <i>because</i> there were only two of us that one of us <i>had</i> to be more loved than the other? Or at least I think it was that way? Everything feels like it was such a long time ago and I wasn't really paying attention to the tiny details that were going through my head at the time so it's hard to clearly remember what it was I even thought. I can't speak for what my sister thought, but I remember getting jealous whenever she got something new or was praised or was the center of attention? For example, one year it was her birthday and she got this beautiful <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4112TK66RGL._SX355_.jpg"> Serafina Stuffed Cat</a> as a present. I remember getting so upset and crying how it wasn't fair that Amanda got a toy. Now, I know I was being rude and irrational, but I was a kid back then and didn't know any better. In the end my mom ended up buying me one as well--so I guess in a way I felt that either I have whatever nice things that Amanda had or else Amanda couldn't have nice things at all? I think that a big reason for why I felt that Amanda shouldn't get nice things (back then and now) was that she's such an awful person who only cares about herself. Why should she be entitled to nice things when she doesn't "deserve" them? Similarly, it's like thinking that all the bad kids get coal on Christmas because they deserve it--but Amanda got good things even though she was bad.
</p>
<br></br>
<h2><b>MOM</b></h2>
<p>Out of everyone in my family, I am probably closest with my mom. I feel comfortable to share things with her, but not everything. While she is like a friend to me, she's still my mom and holds the power of being my mom so I'm weary to let her into my life too much. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd say that much of my personality comes from my mom. We are both penny pincers and love finding the best deals when we spend money. We're both quiet and have a similar sense of humor. Sometimes when my mom can see herself in me, she's happy. But other times, it makes her upset. For example, when she was younger she was a pushover too--being an Asian-American in Vietnam after the war made her an easy target for bullies and she let fear of others control her life. Nowadays, she has gotten much better about that, but she still does have irrational fears at times. Like before, she would not let me walk up and down alone on our dead-end street because she thought that I would get kidnapped/raped/etc. Even today, she doesn't like the idea of me walking alone in front of our house so she always makes one of my younger brothers go with me. When she sees me crying or afraid to do things she gets upset and tells me that I have to be stronger--as long as it isn't opposing her wishes. If I were to go "against" her, she would make me feel guilty until I stop whatever it was she didn't like.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mom grew up with her mother and her younger sister. Her father was stationed in Vietnam for the war and didn't play much of a role in my mom's life other than naming her. My grandmother is an interesting and unpredicatable person who probably had her own demons to deal with. But my mom always says that even though her mother was not perfect, she did everything she could to give her children everything. My mom's younger sister developed some sort of health condition during puberty that left her unable to build muscle and to use it. There is probably a technical name for it, but being that my mom's first language isn't English and that my mom is not very educated she isn't able to tell me and my siblings things in great detail. Because my aunt was disabled, my mother learned how to care for others at a young age and has been putting people first ever since.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mom is caring just like any other mom, but at times it feels suffocating?</p>
<br></br>

<h2><b>DAD</b></h2>
<p>I guess you could say that my dad was the stereotypical Asian dad? By stereotypical, I mean that he's extremely stubborn and prideful. He loved to be your father when you did something good and never took the blame for when something bad happened--that was supposedly my mom's job. To be honest, growing up my dad worked the third shift at work so I only remember spending time with him on the weekend until he was promoted and consequently worked more conventional hours. Because of that, my siblings and I grew up closer to my mom than my dad. Nonetheless, my dad cared greatly for us and tried to give us everything we needed, but he was excessive. He was the type of person to "go big or go home". He likes brand name items, he likes showing off what we have, he likes the positive attention that comes with being "better" than others. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It wasn't that my dad was strict--but when it came to things it <i>had</i> to be exactly how he wanted or he would get into one of his moods. My dad doesn't like anyone telling him what to do. He doesn't like being told that he's wrong or that he made a mistake. No matter how obviously wrong he is, he will just choose to not accept it and ignore the other person. For example, he once asked me what building the math department at UB was in and I told him the "Mathematics Building". He didn't believe me of course and was offering up other names to try to "jog" my memory. But when I was showing him the building and its name on the campus map, he refused to even look at it and completely dropped the subject. I'm not upset about these types of things--it's just something that I've learned to accept about my dad. But sometimes it really does bother me that he won't listen to the ideas and suggestions of others.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Growing up, my dad was a body builder and placed a lot of emphasis in being fit and looking good. When he was a teenager, he looked up immensely to Arnold Schwarzenegger and aimed to be just like him. Since my dad had weight lifting as a hobby, you would think that he would be more educated about health and nutrition and etc. But the only things he believes in are the things he knows. Recently, my dad was diagnosed with diabetes and it has really taken a toll on his body. But he refuses to listen to what other people say. He shouldn't be eating so much sugar, processed foods, fats, and etc but he does it anyway. When people are diabetic, they're supposed to <i>lose</i> weight, but my dad wants to <i>gain</i> weight. Not in the sense of a feederism fetish or anything, he just wants to maintain his muscular physique. Which I understand. From an American standpoint, my dad is not obese at all--I suspect that his case of diabetes is due to his 100% Asian genes. (My mom and my siblings are all part "American", so my dad is the only "full" Asian) Typically, Asians are at a higher risk than their western counterparts at developing health issues at certain weights, so it's best for them to be slim. But I would venture to think that in my dad's mind that being slim is equated to being weak and not masculine. Looking back at my dad's history, he was the second youngest child out of ten children and grew up during the aftermath of the Vietnam War. His parents were probably upper-middle class and ran their own noodle factory and he was spoiled immensely by his parents. Even today, my dad is still secretive about much of his personal life from back then, but I definitely think that how he was raised impacted his personality and caused him to develop that "bigger is better" mentality.
