<p>They say that the majority of people suffering from eating disorders have some sort of latent conflict regarding their families. I suppose to an extent this may be true? Personally, I never really gave it much thought that the people I am continuously surrounded by could somehow contribute to my unhealthy eating habits. But now that I think of it, I guess that over the course of my life, my family has played a role in my eating habits and attitude towards food. I am in no way placing the blame on my family for what I've become--I fully accept responsibility for my actions. But in my quest to figure out what is "wrong" with me, I have no choice but to pick at my family and see if there is anything significant in helping me understand myself better. </p>
<br></br>
<h2><b>AMANDA</b></h2>
<p>My family consists of seven people: my mom, my dad, my younger sister, my three younger brothers, and then me. Even thoguh my parents are far from perfect, they took care of us to the best of their ability. My siblings and I are all born a year apart, so we pretty much grew up together. My memory isn't as good as it used to be, but I'd say that I got along very well with my brothers--except for the occasional argument of course. But my sister, Amanda, and I were like cat and dog. I remember getting into arguements with her almost every day. It drove my parents crazy. And truth be told, even to this day my sister and I don't really get along as much but usually we are amiable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I vividly remember certain snippets of my childhood when I fought with my sister. I remember she would threaten to touch my belongings and I would panic so much and cry like a baby. There were times I would hide all my things and/or guard them just to make sure that they were safe from her. I remember that she used to bully me until I was in tears and that she never hesitated to hurt my feelings. Back then, it must have been over stupid, little things that would only bother children. I barely remember what it was she said to me, but I remember crying constantly because of her. There were times where I just cried and cried to cope with my feelings towards my sister, but there were also times I tried to get "even". For example, one day in elementary school, I got so fed up of Amanda and for some reason I decided to pee on her bed because I was so upset. When I look back, I question what it was that I was thinking--but I think it was so that my mom would see the mess and yell at Amanda. That way perhaps she would cry and feel the pain that comes with it? But my sister and I are two different people. She has a strong personality and lets little bother her while I am the complete opposite. Compared to my younger sister, I'm a total pushover.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the only two girls in the house, I guess we were supposed to get along with one another and have a great relationship. But instead of seeing things that way we somehow saw it as <i>because</i> there were only two of us that one of us <i>had</i> to be more loved than the other? Or at least I think it was that way? Everything feels like it was such a long time ago and I wasn't really paying attention to the tiny details that were going through my head at the time so it's hard to clearly remember what it was I even thought. I can't speak for what my sister thought, but I remember getting jealous whenever she got something new or was praised or was the center of attention? For example, one year it was her birthday and she got this beautiful <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4112TK66RGL._SX355_.jpg"> Serafina Stuffed Cat</a> as a present. I remember getting so upset and crying how it wasn't fair that Amanda got a toy. Now, I know I was being rude and irrational, but I was a kid back then and didn't know any better. In the end my mom ended up buying me one as well--so I guess in a way I felt that either I have whatever nice things that Amanda had or else Amanda couldn't have nice things at all? I think that a big reason for why I felt that Amanda shouldn't get nice things (back then and now) was that she's such an awful person who only cares about herself. Why should she be entitled to nice things when she doesn't "deserve" them? Similarly, it's like thinking that all the bad kids get coal on Christmas because they deserve it--but Amanda got good things even though she was bad.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Growing up, my sister was always a bit chubby--she wasn't fat, but she was definitely rounder than my other siblings and I. Back then when "thin" was popular my sister felt self-conscious about her body and tried to lose weight. She would try to exercise more and eat better, but she couldn't make the changes in her lifestyle long enough to see worthwhile results. Looking back at my diaries that I kept, I wrote that I didn't want her to "be better" than me? I didn't want her getting more positive attention from my parents and others because she was losing weight. I was never fat--but I was a bit pudgy at my heaviest. I had an overweight BMI of 25 to 26. But from the way I dressed to cover myself, I looked "small". In my mind, if my sister could try to lose weight, then I could try to lose weight too. It's not that I blame my sister for anything, rather I blame my nature of wanting to be the best and wanting to be praised as the catalyst of my eating disorder. But if I had to blame her for one thing, I think it would be putting the idea of purging in my head. For a month's time or so, my sister went around claiming she was bulimic and would try to purge whatever she ate in order to lose weight. At first I thought it was ridiculous. But a couple years later, I thought about that time and ended up purging as well. Now I purge any where from a once very couple months to once every day of the week. It's all up to my mood and what I ate that day.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As time went on, my sister stopped having interest in becoming thin and embraced being "thicc". But I kept on going. Overall, I lost about a third of my original body weight--my size now rivals the size of when I was a 3rd or 4th grader. My sister is probably double my weight now. Whenever I see her, my mind can't help to think that if I let myself go or stop caring about my body that I'll look exactly like her. I don't want that at all. I put so many years and tears and effort into losing all this weight how could I just mindlessly eat like her and put it back on? She's a constant reminder of what I would become if I stop caring.
</p>
<p>Another way that my sister "triggers" me is when she misbehaves. My sister has always been more outspoken than me and the rebellious one. I'm more of a timid, calm, well-behaved person. Recently what has beeen bothering me the most about my sister is her relationship with Mike (her boyfriend/fiancee). She knew Mike for less than half a year before they decided to get married. She also stays out late all the time even though she was told not to and she leaves the house whenever she wants without asking for any permission. My sister disregards everything my parents say and does whatever she wants all the time and never ever gets punished for it. They don't even bother to yell at her. My parents don't really like Mike, but they treat him so well. My dad even got Mike a full-time job with benefits at the same workplace as him! And my mom always talks to him and tries to make him feel at home because she pities he had a rough childhood. My mom also doesn't want to yell at my sister because she's afraid of losing her daughter. All of this just makes me so so mad. I hate that they're so lenient on my trouble maker sister while they give me a tough time. My mom says it's because I'm their "favorite" that they care about me more, but I don't know. It just all feels so unfair to me and puts me off of eating. If they love Amanda so much just make her eat and leave me the fuck alone. I remember that I would blatantly refuse to eat whenever Mike came over, but that would only make my mom mad and yell at me. I know life isn't fair, but I don't know how my mom can sit there and tell me to my face that everything she does is fair and that I shouldn't be so bothered about it. Trey (my boyfriend) and I have been dating for almost five years--and I'm only allowed to see him if it's more convenient for my mom for him to take me to school or if he asks in advance to go out for a date. And my mom doesn't even refer to him as my boyfriend. Trey does so much for her--he took her to the emergency room when she wasn't feeling well, he helped fix our SUV when it stopped running, and etc (This is starting to get off topic but we can touch on this later). But in essence, the difference in how my parents treat my sister's relationship and my relationship makes me feel angry and there's no outlet for me other than what I already know--to starve and overexercise.
</p>





<br></br>
<h2><b>MOM</b></h2>
<p>Out of everyone in my family, I am probably closest with my mom. I feel comfortable to share things with her, but not everything. While she is like a friend to me, she's still my mom and holds the power of being my mom so I'm weary to let her into my life too much. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I'd say that much of my personality comes from my mom. We are both penny pincers and love finding the best deals when we spend money. We're both quiet and have a similar sense of humor. Sometimes when my mom can see herself in me, she's happy. But other times, it makes her upset. For example, when she was younger she was a pushover too--being an Asian-American in Vietnam after the war made her an easy target for bullies and she let fear of others control her life. Nowadays, she has gotten much better about that, but she still does have irrational fears at times. Like before, she would not let me walk up and down alone on our dead-end street because she thought that I would get kidnapped/raped/etc. Even today, she doesn't like the idea of me walking alone in front of our house so she always makes one of my younger brothers go with me. When she sees me crying or afraid to do things she gets upset and tells me that I have to be stronger--as long as it isn't opposing her wishes. If I were to go "against" her, she would make me feel guilty until I stop whatever it was she didn't like.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mom grew up with her mother and her younger sister. Her father was stationed in Vietnam for the war and didn't play much of a role in my mom's life other than naming her. My grandmother is an interesting and unpredicatable person who probably had her own demons to deal with. But my mom always says that even though her mother was not perfect, she did everything she could to give her children everything. My mom's younger sister developed some sort of health condition during puberty that left her unable to build muscle and to use it. There is probably a technical name for it, but being that my mom's first language isn't English and that my mom is not very educated she isn't able to tell me and my siblings things in great detail. Because my aunt was disabled, my mother learned how to care for others at a young age and has been putting people first ever since.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mom is caring just like any other mom, but at times it feels suffocating? My mom is the kind of person who likes to think that she is always reasonable and right and gets stubborn at times--though she isn't as stubborn as my dad. It's hard to reason with my mom when she's not in the modd to listen, but usually talking with her isn't that bad. My mom also has this bad habit of making people feel guilty when she's upset. For example, I once wanted to buy a pair dumbbells (which maybe costed a total of $8), but the whole time I was holding them while in the store my mom was moody and giving me the silent treatment until I decided to put them back on my own. After that she immediately changed her attitude and was happy and talkative again.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>She, as well as a few of other family members and myself included, has a passive-aggressive streak in her. I mean, every person has their own way to deal with things, but having to be constantly worried that my mom may be upset and not telling us that she's upset stresses me out and makes me feel paranoid of doing something that will make her attitude worse. I'm guilty of not telling others when I'm upset, but as a mother, her being upset is much more serious than me being upset. If that makes any sense. I don't like having to over-analyze everything that I want to do and/or plan to do so that I don't end up stepping on her toes.
</p>
<br></br>







<h2><b>DAD</b></h2>
<p>I guess you could say that my dad was the stereotypical Asian dad? By stereotypical, I mean that he's extremely stubborn and prideful. He loved to be your father when you did something good and never took the blame for when something bad happened--that was supposedly my mom's job. To be honest, growing up my dad worked the third shift at work so I only remember spending time with him on the weekend until he was promoted and consequently worked more conventional hours. Because of that, my siblings and I grew up closer to my mom than my dad. Nonetheless, my dad cared greatly for us and tried to give us everything we needed, but he was excessive. He was the type of person to "go big or go home". He likes brand name items, he likes showing off what we have, he likes the positive attention that comes with being "better" than others. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It wasn't that my dad was strict--but when it came to things it <i>had</i> to be exactly how he wanted or he would get into one of his moods. My dad doesn't like anyone telling him what to do. He doesn't like being told that he's wrong or that he made a mistake. No matter how obviously wrong he is, he will just choose to not accept it and ignore the other person. For example, he once asked me what building the math department at UB was in and I told him the "Mathematics Building". He didn't believe me of course and was offering up other names to try to "jog" my memory. But when I was showing him the building and its name on the campus map, he refused to even look at it and completely dropped the subject. I'm not upset about these types of things--it's just something that I've learned to accept about my dad. But sometimes it really does bother me that he won't listen to the ideas and suggestions of others.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Growing up, my dad was a body builder and placed a lot of emphasis in being fit and looking good. When he was a teenager, he looked up immensely to Arnold Schwarzenegger and aimed to be just like him. Since my dad had weight lifting as a hobby, you would think that he would be more educated about health and nutrition and etc. But the only things he believes in are the things he knows. Recently, my dad was diagnosed with diabetes and it has really taken a toll on his body. But he refuses to listen to what other people say. He shouldn't be eating so much sugar, processed foods, fats, and etc but he does it anyway. When people are diabetic, they're supposed to <i>lose</i> weight, but my dad wants to <i>gain</i> weight. Not in the sense of a feederism fetish or anything, he just wants to maintain his muscular physique. Which I understand. From an American standpoint, my dad is not obese at all--I suspect that his case of diabetes is due to his 100% Asian genes. (My mom and my siblings are all part "American", so my dad is the only "full" Asian) Typically, Asians are at a higher risk than their western counterparts at developing health issues at certain weights, so it's best for them to be slim. But I would venture to think that in my dad's mind that being slim is equated to being weak and not masculine. Looking back at my dad's history, he was the second youngest child out of ten children and grew up during the aftermath of the Vietnam War. His parents were probably upper-middle class and ran their own noodle factory and he was spoiled immensely by his parents. Even today, my dad is still secretive about much of his personal life from back then, but I definitely think that how he was raised impacted his personality and caused him to develop that "bigger is better" mentality.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was younger, I was proud of my dad. I thought he was amazing and brilliant. But I guess the thing about getting older is seeing the flaws in your parents. My opinion of my dad has changed drastically over the years. Sometimes I think that we would be better off if he left us or died, but that's too harsh of a thing to think about. My family is dependent on him and his income so without him life would be very tough. But with him life is tough as well. My dad knows very little about my personal life and I lie to him constantly about it. I guess a part of the reason why I don't tell him much about my personal life is because it's just part of the Asian culture. Fathers and daughters in Asia don't really share personal things with one another--there's an unsaid boundary between what's appropriate to talk about and what isn't. To talk about relationships and the like would make my dad feel uncomfortable since to him, I'm still his little girl. Not to mention that he wouldn't approve since a relationship could distract me from my studies. I also haven't had the guts to tell him that I'm not actually studying to be a lawyer. I'm afraid that he'll get mad and yell at me or be disappointed. I like the idea of being a lawyer and arguing a case in court, but I cannot bring myself to possibly lie for a living. Instead I'm majoring in Applied Mathematics, but I don't think he would be happy about it. He's so set on me being a lawyer and eventually a judge that I really can't bring myself to shatter his vision of me.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mom says that I'm too cold in my thinking of my dad, but I feel that it's better to be safe than sorry. I think throughout my life, he has only yelled directly at me once on my 9th or 10th birthday. But I saw his bouts of anger before and I guess those are why I get anxious when I hear unanticipated loud noises. Just to be clear, my dad is a good father and was not abusive to any of us. But living with him is like living with a ticking time bomb. You never know when he will explode or how great the damage will be. Once, he threatened my mom with divorce since she told him that we need to spend less (long story short: my dad thinks he makes a lot of money while in reality he doesn't, my mom takes cares of the books and we are knee deep in debt). This happened when I was maybe 12 or 13 years old? Maybe younger, it's been so long I can't remember for certain but it was when I was in 5th grade? I would say it was at that time, where I became more weary of upsetting my dad and started drifting away from him. Now, if I had the choice, I wouldn't really spend my time with him due to his personality. But what pains me is that all of my other siblings think the same way. None of them would willingly choose to spend time with him if they had the choice. That makes me feel sorry for my dad. He has five children, but none of them wants to spend time with him.
